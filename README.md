<h1>E-Commerce Application</h1>
Secondly, the E-Commerce Application. It has a theme of Red and White combination which attracts the users on their first sight and all other features are simple and standard. 
The Interface was clean, intuitive, and gives a visually appealing experience that emphasizes ease of navigation, clear product presentation, and smooth transaction flow
